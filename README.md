# MentalHealth
Analyzing the mental health of students.



## Overview

RStudio was used to create a software program written in the R programming language. The program will read a.csv file containing mental health statistics and analyze specific columns to return useful graphs from which insights into student mental health can be gained.Â 

As a student, mental health is very important to me. Like many other students, I have suffered from depression and anxiety due to the demands of school and life. Having a better insight into what types of students are more prone to developing mental health issues allows professionals to offer tailored services and better preventative measures.
