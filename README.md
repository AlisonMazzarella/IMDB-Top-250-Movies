# IMDB Top 250 Movies
Analyzing IMDB's Top 250 Movies dataset.



## Overview

RStudio was used to create a software program written in the R programming language. The program will read a .csv file containing movie statistics and analyze specific columns to return useful graphs from which insights into top movies can be gained. 

As a student, most of my free time is spent watching movies. After a long, stressful day working on programming, movies help me relax my mind. However, there's always the question, "What should I watch?" There are so many movies saturating the market that sometimes it's hard to choose what to watch. Knowing what movies are on the "Top 250 Movies" list helps identify which ones are worth a try. Analyzing data on top movies also helps those in the entertainment industry identify trends in what genres are currently popular, what types of movies made their money back at the box office, and which actors are having a great year.
